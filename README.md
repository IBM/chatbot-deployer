# IBM Cloud Pipeline based Chatbot Deployer

The chatbot deployer is a [IBM Cloud pipeline](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery/pipeline_working.html#pipeline-working) plugin that is to be used in the new [Bot Asset Exchange](https://developer.ibm.com/code/exchanges/bots/).

### How do I use it?

1. Navigate over to the [Bot Asset Exchange](https://developer.ibm.com/code/exchanges/bots/) and click the `Get this bot` button.

2. Log into IBM Cloud if prompted
3. Choose to create the pipeline
4. That's it! Now now click the _Watson Conversation_ icon to see the new _Watson Conversation_ service (entitled `Bot Asset Exchange Workspaces`) that was just created.
5. Launch the _Watson Conversation_ service, find the workspace (the bot you picked!).

#### As an example:

### What's it do?

Clicking the `Get this bot` button will:

* Create an IBM Cloud DevOps pipeline
* Create a _Watson Conversation_ service called `Bot Asset Exchange Workspaces`
* Upload the `workspace.json` file, which represents the bot you selected, into the newly created service

### Testing it out:

Underneath the covers, we hit the DevOps Service ``https://console.bluemix.net/devops/setup/deploy`` with three arguments:

1. URL escaped repository link, for example ``repository=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FIBM%2Fchatbot-deployer``
2. Bot Name, for example ``chatbotName=Chatbot``
3. Workspace URL, for example: ``chatbotWorkspaceURL=chatbotWorkspaceURL=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FIBM%2Fchatbot-deployer%2Fraw%2Fmaster%2Fdata%2Fworkspace.json``

Click [this link](https://console.bluemix.net/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FIBM%2Fchatbot-deployer&chatbotName=Chatbot&chatbotWorkspaceURL=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FIBM%2Fchatbot-deployer%2Fraw%2Fmaster%2Fdata%2Fworkspace.json) to try it out.

## Privacy Notice

The DevOps pipeline that is included in this package is configured by default with a [Deployment Tracker](https://github.com/IBM/metrics-collector-service) tool. The following information is sent when a user deploys an asset from the Bot Asset Exchange:

* Space ID
* Conversation Service GUID
* Chatbot Name

By default, this data is collected from the IBM Cloud DevOps pipeline environment variables in IBM Cloud. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Cloud to measure the usefulness of our examples, so that we can continuously improve the content we offer to you. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.

## Disabling Deployment Tracking

To opt-out the tracker, Simply select `NO` in *Metrics Tracker* under the **Delivery Pipeline** section when you create your IBM Cloud DevOps pipeline.
