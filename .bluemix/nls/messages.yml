template.description: "Develop a Watson conversion application, automating the initial Watson training, By default, the toolchain clones a sample Node.js app into an IBM hosted Git repo, which you can then modify.  This toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery, source control, issue tracking, Slack notifications and online editing.\n\nThe toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service.  If an instance of that service isnâ€™t already in your organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added at no cost to you. For more information and terms, see the [IBM Cloud catalog](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/).\n\nTo get started, click **Create**."
template.gettingStarted: "**Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Use the Watson Conversation tool to train the service for new intents, or modify the dialog flow. Or modify the app logic or its appearance by committing a change to the Git repo to trigger a new build and deployment. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/tutorials/tutorial_toolchain_cfv2?task=2) for this toolchain."
